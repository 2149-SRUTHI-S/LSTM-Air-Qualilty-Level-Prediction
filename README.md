# LSTM-Air-Qualilty-Level-Prediction

**Dataset**

In this, I have used the Air Quality dataset. This is a dataset that reports on the weather and the level of pollution each hour for five years at the US embassy in Beijing, China. The data includes the date-time, the pollution called PM2.5 concentration, and the weather information including dew point, temperature, pressure, wind direction, wind speed and the cumulative number of hours of snow and rain

**Data visualization**

Used boxplot
Correlation matrix

**LSTM Model**

3 layer LSTM architecture with 50 neuron followed by 1 nueron LSTM
Dropout at 20% after every layer
